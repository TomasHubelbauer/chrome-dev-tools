# Chrome DevTools Updates

[**WEB**](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/capabilities)

This repository contains a script which downloads the list of updates to the
Chrome DevTools as documented on developers.google.com as well as a generated
snapshot of the content generated by the script that follows below.

It uses `dotnet script` which you can install by running

```
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script
```

The repository was bootstrapped using `dotnet script init` and you can run the
script using `dotnet script main.csx`.

## To-Do

### Await support response about using `dotnet tool`

Cannot use `dotnet-script` because it asks for a restart, which I can't do on
the agent.

### Add personal notes to each feature

### Do not commit if there are no updates

Right now there are always some due to the stamp.
