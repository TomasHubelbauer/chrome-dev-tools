# Chrome DevTools Updates

This repository contains a script which downloads the list of updates to the
Chrome DevTools as documented on developers.google.com as well as a generated
snapshot of the content generated by the script that follows below.

It uses `dotnet script` which you can install by running

```
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script
```

The repository was bootstrapped using `dotnet script init` and you can run the
script using `dotnet script main.csx`.
