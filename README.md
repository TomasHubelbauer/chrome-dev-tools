# Chrome DevTools Updates

[**WEB**](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/capabilities)

This repository contains a script which downloads the list of updates to the
Chrome DevTools as documented on developers.google.com as well as a generated
snapshot of the content generated by the script that follows below.

It uses `dotnet script` which you can install by running

```
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script
```

The repository was bootstrapped using `dotnet script init` and you can run the
script using `dotnet script main.csx`.

## To-Do

### Fix `dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script` not working due to PATH change

Either add `~/.dotnet/tools` to PATH prior to running `dotnet tool install` or
use `--tool-path` to install to a directory that's already on the PATH.

### Add personal notes to each feature

### Do not commit if there are no updates

Right now there are always some due to the stamp.

### Fix the script resulting in an empty MarkDown section
